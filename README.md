# Newtype Learning Computer 
A VHDL (and eventually Memristive) implementation of ESA's SNN4Space project.

## Introduction
This project contains a hardware design for ESA's SNN4Space Machine Learning project. It takes the converted SNN implementation and decomposes it into (recurring) blocks, each block then has a hardware block designed which performs a (mathematically) equivalent function but in hardware rather than in software. These blocks are then collected and used to do inference on an image using the pre-trained weights from the software implementation.
